AIAYN samediff implementation attempt

To run the model, 

download all the files using the same directory structure

then run 

/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/trajectorypredictiontransformer/LocationNextNeuralNetworkV7_04.java

If I set the directory structure correctly, it should run and fail as I described in my messages.

Contact me with any issues.

Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.
